## Existing Features

The platform curently consists of 3 apps:
- Users
- Forum
- Plants

The Users app has the functionality of user registration and login

The Forum app allows users to post in the forum and also reply to others' posts

The Plants app allows users to create a list of plants they planted, takes notes about the plant also state whether or not they are happy with the outcome. 

### Forum

This is the space for garden gossip! Allotment users usually like sharing information with others about plants and tips for success. The platform will provide users with a forum space where they communicate with each other.

### Plants

A good planting planning requires plot holders to make notes about what they planted and where. HAnd-written notes are likely to get lost or take time to organize. The platform provides plot holders with a digital space where they can easily make lists of their plants as well as taking notes about their plants and mark whether or not the plant grew well.  

## Data Model

The Django Database Structure consists of three models: User, Forum and Plant. This is represented by the Entry Relationship Diagram below.

## Future Features

### WikiPlant

Plot holders usually experiment with planting a variety fruit, herb or vegetables but sometimes they may not know enough about different plants, in particular when they are newbies. WikiPlant pages will allow users to search for plants and obtain information about when to plant, where, what harvest to expect, etc.

### My allotment

A good planting planning requires plot holders to make notes about what they planted and where. These notes are likely to get lost or take time to organize. Markings left on the planting spots usually get lost too due to rain, wind, or some other external factors. The platform may provide plot holders with a digital representation of their allotment space where they can mark on the digital allotment map what plants are planted, where. 

### Tasks of the month

This space provides information about the gardening tasks that are recommended to take place in each month.

### Integration of Predictive Algorithms

- Analysis of the most popular plants planted by the users in a location
- Analysis of the success rates of plants planted by users in a location
   
## Testing

*To be added*

## Deploying the App on Heroku

### In the local project folder:

1.  Install `gunicorn` by running `pip install gunicorn~=20.1` from the terminal

2.  Add this installation to the requirements file by running `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`

3.  Create a `Procfile` at the root directory of the project, declaring the process as `web` and adding a start command. The`Procfile` should then read `web: gunicorn happy_green_space.wsgi`

4.  In the `happy_green_space/settings.py` set the `DEBUG` constant to `False`. Append the `'.herokuapp.com'` hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list.

5.  Update Git Repository

### In the Heroku account:

6.  In the Heroku account dashboard, create new app choosing Europe as the location.

    ![Create new app screenshot 2](./assets/images/read_me/deployment/dss02.png)

7.  From the `Settings`, `Config Vars` section, create a `key` of `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` with `value` of `1`

    ![Set Config Vars screenshot](./assets/images/read_me/deployment/dss03.png)

8.  In `Deploy`, after providing GitHub Repository details, click on `Deploy Branch` in the `Manual deploy` section.
